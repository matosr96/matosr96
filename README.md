## Something about me

I am a full-stack developer with experience in working with React and TypeScript on the front-end, and Node.js, TypeScript, and Fastify on the back-end. I primarily use MongoDB as my database, but I also have experience with MySQL. I am a systems technician and software engineering student. I am from Colombia and currently serve as a Teach Lead at Real Vision Enterprise. My goal is to continue developing my skills and experience in the technology field to provide high-quality solutions for my clients.

- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on interesting projects
